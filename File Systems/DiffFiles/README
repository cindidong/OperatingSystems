File diff generator and processor for online transfer. Creates a diff file for 2 files (1 old version and 1 new version). Sending the changes between the 2 files through a shorter diff file that has instructions on how to edit the old file into the new file is faster than just sending the entire new file. Used a hash table to determine the differences between an old file and a new file. Wrote those differences into a new file. Also reads the difference file to change the old file to the new file. main.cpp holds the code, the text files are examples of old and new files (those ending with a 1 are the old file and those ending with 2 are the new files).
